Installation
============


WorkBench is under active development. A package based installer is
currently not available.


Install from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


WorkBench (``wb``) is a single bash file. You can use ``curl`` or ``wget`` to fetch
the bleeding edge ``wb`` script from the WorkBench repository.


Using curl
----------

.. code:: bash

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pshirali/workbench/master/wb > wb

Using wget
----------

.. code:: bash

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pshirali/workbench/master/wb


Ensure that ``wb`` is placed in a folder which is in your ``PATH``.
Set the execute bit for ``wb`` by running ``chmod +x <path/to/wb>``
