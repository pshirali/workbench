Testing
=======


WorkBench was built with TDD. Unittests are written in Python3's
unittest framework. They are best run with Python 3.7.

Tests can be run by cloning the repo and executing ``make test``

Code coverage is on the cards using ``bashcov``. This can be taken up
after an enhancement in `bashcov` Issue-47_ is addressed.
