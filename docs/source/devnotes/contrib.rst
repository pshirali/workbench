Contribution
============


You are welcome to contribute to the WorkBench project.

WorkBench has been built with the philosophy of `less-is-more`. It is
nearly feature complete. No big features are planned. Improvements however
are always welcome.


Where can I contribute?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can contribute to:

1. Discussing and suggesting improvements to provide hooks or tweaks,
   such that WorkBench could be adopted for use in more scenarios.
2. Testing: WorkBench compatibiltiy tests are work-in-progress. This
   involves testing against various bash versions and against other
   shells (zsh, ash, etc)
3. A plan to start a Wiki is on the cards, where you can contribute your
   ideas and recipies on the best ways to use WorkBench.


How do I start?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


You must start a discussion by opening a Github Issue first. You'll be
guided on the next steps through the discussion. PR which don't go through
this route will probably be rejected.
